# Hacky_C_Tricks

This is a repository containing some weird hacky C programs I have written.
They're basically just programs that "break the rules" in some way.

There is no 100% guarantee these will run as intended on your machine as 
your operating system may lay out variables and memory segments differently.

They almost definitely will not run on Windows or BSD as these operating systems' 
implementations of ASLR and memory management differ. 

They obviously will not work if compiled as PIE.
